# SQL Portfolio

Coding test SQL solutions organized by platform and difficulty.

## Structure
- `HackerRank/`
  - `Easy.sql` — Easy problems (multiple solutions in one file)
  - `Medium.sql` — Medium problems (multiple solutions in one file)
- `Programmers/`
  - `Programmers_Level1.sql`
  - `Programmers_Level2.sql`
  - `Programmers_Level3.sql`
  - `Programmers_Level4.sql`

## SQL Dialect
- Primary: **(write one: MySQL)**
- Notes:
  - Queries are written to be readable and interview-friendly (clear CTEs, naming, comments).
  - Some platforms use slightly different functions/syntax depending on dialect.

## How to read
Each `.sql` file contains multiple problems.
Every problem block includes:
- Problem name
- Link
- Short description
- Solution query

Tip: Use editor search (`Cmd+F`) to find a problem by name.

## Topics covered
- Aggregation & GROUP BY
- JOINs
- Subqueries
- CTEs
- Window functions (when applicable)
- Conditional logic (CASE)
- Date/time handling (when applicable)
